Brief description of each .lgr:

[blow.lgr](blow.lgr) Don't bother, it's edj with uglier lines.

[cedj.lgr](cedj.lgr) Coloured-edj. Quite pretty, this is my current recommendation.

[dajrk.lgr](dajrk.lgr) <Unsure>

[dejtaijl.lgr](dejtaijl.lgr) Coloured-edj-with-shading. This is the next product, it looks OK but is unfinished. My other recommendation.

[edj.lgr](edj.lgr) Black and white, edjes highlighted. Quite cool.

[hween.lgr](hween.lgr) Made by accident, halloween lgr.

[jej.lgr](jej.lgr) <Thought I deleted this>

[lumi.lgr](lumi.lgr) Quite psychedelic, messing around with palettes.

[psych.lgr](psych.lgr) Quite a bit mroe psychedelic.

[retrofix.lgr](retrofix.lgr) Retro with suspup fixed.

[silver.lgr](silver.lgr) Luminosity of each pixel converted into a lgr, looks good.

[tejtro.lgr](tejtro.lgr) My version of retro, character is coloured instead of all black and some colours are changed.

[trjd2.lgr](trjd2.lgr) High-saturation default. Made in photoshop, not scripts, will probably remove.
