# .Lgr's available #

## Recommended ##

[dejtaijl.lgr](LGR/dejtaijl.lgr) Coloured-edj-with-shading. My top recommendation, this is the (unfinished but eventual) "final product".

[cedj.lgr](LGR/cedj.lgr) Coloured-edj. Quite pretty, this is my current recommendation for people who like retro, flat, simple LGRs.

[edj.lgr](LGR/edj.lgr) Black and white, edjes highlighted. Quite cool. Outerspace-matrix-like.

[tejtro.lgr](LGR/tejtro.lgr) My version of retro, character is coloured instead of all black and many colours are changed.

## Not recommended ##

[blow.lgr](LGR/notrecommended/blow.lgr) Old, ugly edj.

[dajrk.lgr](LGR/notrecommended/dajrk.lgr) Very odd, black and white "water colour" feel. Some things are partly invisible. dajrk is used as data in the generation of dejtaijl, so it's not meant to be an LGR.

[hween.lgr](LGR/notrecommended/hween.lgr) Made by accident, halloween lgr.

[jej.lgr](LGR/notrecommended/jej.lgr) Very early version of cedj, not good.

[lumi.lgr](LGR/notrecommended/lumi.lgr) Quite psychedelic, messing around with palettes.

[psych.lgr](LGR/notrecommended/psych.lgr) Quite a bit mroe psychedelic.

[retrofix.lgr](LGR/notrecommended/retrofix.lgr) Retro with 'suspup.bmp' fixed.

[silver.lgr](LGR/notrecommended/silver.lgr) Luminosity of each pixel converted into a lgr, looks good, but palette is greyscale and has a red artifact.

[trjd2.lgr](LGR/notrecommended/trjd2.lgr) High-saturation default. Made in photoshop, not scripts, will probably remove.
